    "section": "General sustainable digitalization challenges",
    "text": "General sustainable digitalization challenges\nIn general, integrating sustainability objectives into digitalization is seen as taking too much time. One central issue that was identified is the lack of a definition or conceptualization of sustainability, digitalization, and the combination of those two concepts respectively. As sustainability is increasingly seen as a marketing claim by the public, sustainable digitalization or digital sustainability is also increasingly perceived as a buzzword that leads to increased interest, without sufficient understanding of the underlying concepts.\nEven though theoretical knowledge exists on sustainable digitalization (e.g., in academia and specialized consultancies), access to this information is sometimes limited, not widely known, or difficult to put in practice.\nOn a more structural level, financial resources are oftem missing for integrating sustainability objectives into digitalization processes on the individual, corporate, and societal levels. Funding in the sustainable digitalization domain almost exclusively focuses on efficiency targets. What is more, there is a generally likely over-optimistic, technology-centric view on the opportunities digitalization offers for sustainability.\nFurther, the resource use impacts of digitalization on a micro-level are often hard to define or remain unknown. In fact, it was lamented that methodologies and measurements of CO2 emissions and digital processes are often not fully understood or the necessary data is not available."

    "section": "Specific challenges in societal sectors",
    "text": "Specific challenges in societal sectors\n\nCivil society\nCivil society actors identified technological, social, environmental and political issues.\nFor example, the introduction of SALAMI (sometimes called AI) and bots poses unknown (ethical) risks and challenges for society. Lack of knowledge about these tools and data generation processes among citizens create new issues of digital justice within and across generations. Due to the increased influence of big tech companies and their dominance in citizens‚Äô daily lives, individuals become subject to new forms of exploitative structures (data colonialism) that inhibit their digital sovereignty. Tech-driven solutionism leads to climate change being increasingly debated as a matter of technological solutions, while social aspects are mostly disregarded. In general, there seems to be limited awareness among individuals about the concept of sustainable digitalization.\nThe necessary skills (as required by current technological and social infrastructures) among the broader public for developing and using solutions are limited, or in most cases lacking. Likewise, access to data and information is often lacking, even for information created through the use of public money.\nThe increased consumption, use, and replacement of technological devices that presumably save energy, time and costs lead to rebound effects, where more resources are eventually used to respond to the growing demand for technology, thereby exploiting natural resources. On a micro-level, devices become outdated too fast and have to be substituted too often (e.g., mobile phones), thereby producing tremendous amounts of waste. Besides the production and availability of technological devices, the generation of data has taken on enormous speed and dimensions, consuming extreme amounts of energy.\nRelated to the ubiquity of technical devices, citizens are exposed to an abundance of digital information that poses new challenges regarding the development of new strategies to deal with information overload. In some cases, addiction to digital technologies or social isolation are becoming more common and can cause harm for citizens‚Äô mental health.\n\n\nPrivate sector\nFor corporations and the private sector, the link between digitalization and sustainability and how to think both processes together present a widely unknown territory. While the pressure to become sustainable is widely acknowledged, many corporate actors are not aware or unsure about how to integrate sustainability objectives into digitalization processes, or in current tools that support organizational work flows.\nOne central issue is that corporations seem to try to incorporate sustainable digitalization approach within old business models, without exploring new, transformative ways of doing business. For example, the idea of implementing digital and sustainable work processes along the entire supply chain (production, usage, disposal), in line with a circular economy model, remains in many cases disregarded.\nReasons for the lagging integration of sustainability objectives into existing digitalization processes in the private sector and the lack of new, transformative approaches to doing business are limited time and resources (even coming down eg. lacking space for on-premise servers) for implementing new processes, other priorities by top management, the complexity of services, or the lack of data transfer and exchange across enterprises that are part of the supply chain but which are necessary to adapt and change the processes to become more sustainable.\nThe market seems to lack suitable management tools that incorporate sustainability objectives into digital processes. This can either be due to a lack of knowledge among corporate actors, or due to structural limitations that hinder the development of such tools. Overall, corporate actors seem to miss practical examples or use cases that show the impact and benefit of incorporating sustainability objectives into digital solutions. This also comes along with decisions that have to be taken regarding data providers and servers or work-support-tools that comply with the idea of simultanuously operating digitally and sustainably.\nSimilar to individual citizens, corporations have become dependent on big technological firms and platforms in their daily work practices (e.g., Microsoft, Google). Another challenge that has been identified on the corporate level is the difficulty of navigating through the regulations at the intersection of digitalization and sustainability. For example, on the micro-level, corporations have to deal with an abundance of certifications that are hard to distinguish or deem trustworthy.\n\n\nPolicymakers and state sector\nAlthough authorities have pledged to move sustainability and digitalization forward in a ‚Äútwin transformation‚Äù at least on paper, the connection of both processes has not been thoroughly thought through or enacted on the policy level. Therefore, there is a lack of regulation in that area, a void in responsibility attributions (usually seen as an EU-centered topic), and a general slowness in integrating both dimensions going forward.\nSome legislation even seems to inhibit the sustainable and digital transformation of society, partly due to a strong lobby from the corporate sector that inhibits real change. More specifically, the political and democratic processes are seen by some as unable to keep up with fast-moving developments in the technological sector, and funding is not effectively and rapidly directed to producing (non)-commercial solutions.\nFurthermore, access to publicly financed data is often not made available across regional borders to allow an efficient exchange of information, thereby accelerating processes that go beyond the public sector (e.g., climate, environmental data).\nOn a much higher level, policymakers will need to engage in a debate with society about how the transformation towards a sustainable and digital society impacts current democratic processes, such as elections, tax payments, administration, and deliberate decision-making."

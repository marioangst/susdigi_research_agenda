    "text": "General sustainable digitalization challenges\nüöß todo üöß: edit\nIn general, the process of digital sustainability is seen as taking too much time and only making small progress, thereby showing little real impacts on society or the economy. One central issue that has been identified is the lack of a definition or conceptualization of sustainability, digitalization, and the combination of those two concepts respectively. While sustainability is increasingly seen as a marketing claim by the public, the combination of both concepts now seems to have become a buzzword that leads to increased interest, without sufficient understanding. Even though theoretical knowledge exists on sustainable digitalization (e.g., in academia), access to this information is sometimes limited, not widely known, or difficult to put in practice. On a more structural level, issues have been identified regarding the missing budget for implementing such digital and sustainable solutions on the individual, corporate, and societal level. Instead, current funding decisions are mostly directed towards mere efficiency targets. What is more, there is a general optimistic view on the possibilities that technology offers for sustainability, being falsely heralded as the ultimate solution. In other words, the environmental impacts of digitalization on a micro-level are sometimes not clearly defined or remain unknown. In fact, it was lamented that methodologies and measurements of CO2 emissions and digital processes are partly neither fully understood, nor is the necessary data available."

    "text": "Specific challenges in societal sectors\nüöß todo üöß: edit\nOn the societal level, technological, social, environmental and political issues have been identified. For example, the introduction of AI and bots poses unknown (ethical) risks and challenges for society, whereby the lack of knowledge about these tools and data generation processes among citizens create new issues of digital justice, and within the scope of sustainable practices, also questioning climate justice across generations. Due to the increased influence of big tech companies and their dominance in citizens‚Äô daily lives, individuals become subject to new forms of technological neo-capitalistic structures (data colonialism) that inhibit their digital sovereignty. While climate is increasingly debated within the realm of technological solutions, the social aspects are mostly disregarded. In general, there seems to be limited awareness among individuals about the concept of sustainable digitalization. Thus, the necessary skills among citizens for developing and using solutions are also limited, or in most cases lacking. Likewise, access to data and information that has been financed by public money has also been demanded to become open access to create equal opportunities for individuals. Furthermore, the increased consumption, use, and replacement of technological devices that presumably save energy, time and costs lead to rebound effects, where more resources are eventually used to respond to the growing demand for technology, thereby exploiting natural resources and the environment. On a micro-level, devices become outdated too fast and have to be substituted too often (e.g., mobile phones), thereby producing tremendous amounts of technological trash. Besides the production and availability of technological devices, the generation of data has taken on enormous speed and dimensions (e.g., quant computers, AI), consuming extreme amounts of energy that is not sustainable. Related to the ubiquity of technical devices, citizens are exposed to an abundance of digital information that poses new challenges regarding the development of new strategies to deal with the information overload. In some cases, addiction to digital technologies or social isolation are becoming more common and can cause harm for citizens‚Äô mental health.\nFor corporations and the private sector, the link between digitalization and sustainability and how to think both processes together present a widely unknown territory. While the pressure to become sustainable is widely acknowledged, many corporate actors are not aware how to connect digitalization and sustainability with existing work topics, or how to use tools that are both digital and sustainable that can support organizational work flows. One central issue is that corporations seem to try to incorporate both processes in old business models, without exploring new ways of doing business. For example, the idea of implementing digital and sustainable work processes along the entire supply chain (production, usage, disposal), in line with a circular economy model, remains in many cases disregarded. Reasons for this are limited time and resources (e.g., room for data servers) for implementing new processes, other priorities by the top management, the complexity of services, or the lack of data transfer and exchange across enterprises that are part of the supply chain but which are necessary to adapt and change the processes to become more sustainable. The market seems to lack suitable management tools that incorporate sustainable and digital processes. This can either be due to a lack of knowledge among corporate actors, or due to structural limitations that hinder the development of such tools. Overall, corporate actors seem to miss practical examples or user cases that show the impact and benefit of such sustainable and digital solutions. This also comes along with decisions that have to be taken regarding data providers and servers or work-support-tools that comply with the idea of operating digitally and sustainably. Similar to individual citizens, corporations have become dependent on big technological firms and platforms in their daily work practices (e.g., Microsoft, Google). Another challenge that has been identified on the corporate level is the difficulty of navigating through the regulations at the intersection of digitalization and sustainability. For example, on the micro-level, corporations have to deal with an abundance of certifications that are hard to distinguish or deem trustworthy.\nAlthough authorities have pledged to move sustainability and digitalization forward, the connection of both processes has not been thoroughly thought through or enacted on the policy level. Therefore, there is a lack of regulation in that area, a void in responsibility attributions (usually seen as an EU-centered topic), and a general slowness in moving these two topics forward. Some legislation even seems to inhibit the sustainable and digital transformation of society, partly due to a strong lobby from the corporate sector that inhibit real change. More specifically, the political and democratic processes do not seem to keep up with the fast-moving developments in the technological sector, and funding is not effectively and rapidly directed to producing (non)-commercial solutions. Furthermore, access to publicly financed data should be made available across regional borders to allow an efficient exchange of information, thereby accelerating processes that go beyond the public sector (e.g., climate, environmental data). However, more wholistically, policymakers should also think in a more structural way about how the transformation towards a sustainable and digital society impacts current democratic processes, such as elections, tax payments, administration, and deliberate decision-making."
